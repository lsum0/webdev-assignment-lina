## 6.  Flowchart - Website 🧭 :

This chart illustrates the interactive behavior and structure of the website:

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Start**  
   User opens the site (`index.html`).

2. **Loading Screen Appears**  
   - Displays animated logo and progress bar  
   - Uses GSAP to wait for all DOM & assets to load

3. **Display Hero Section**  
   - Typed.js animates intro text  
   - GSAP reveals headings, description, and buttons  
   - Custom cursor becomes active

4. **User Scrolls Down**  
   - Triggers the appearance of each section (via AOS.js)  
   - Sticky navigation is activated

5. **Sections Activated**  
   - **About:** Personal intro and goals  
   - **Skills:** Progress bars and tags  
   - **Projects:** Animated cards with descriptions  
   - **Certificates:** Filterable cards + modal preview  
   - **Contact:** Icons and form

6. **User Clicks Certificate**  
   - Modal popup opens showing certificate image

7. **User Submits Form or Reaches Footer**  
   - Form and contact details are displayed

8. **End**  
   - Smooth experience concludes

##  Challenges I Faced 🧱

During the development of this interactive personal portfolio, I encountered several technical and design challenges. Here are the most notable ones:

### 1. Managing Multiple JavaScript Libraries  
Integrating libraries such as GSAP, AOS, Typed.js, and Particles.js required careful script order and configuration to avoid animation conflicts and ensure smooth loading.

### 2. Building a Custom Loading Screen  
Creating a responsive loading screen with animated rings, a logo, and a progress bar was a challenge — especially syncing it with the actual DOM content load without delays.

### 3. Implementing the Custom Cursor  
Designing and animating a dual-layer custom cursor (cursor + follower) using JS and CSS transitions while keeping performance fluid was technically demanding.

### 4. Scroll-Based Animations  
Balancing AOS and GSAP scroll animations across multiple sections required fine-tuning of timing, easing, and trigger points for the best UX.

### 5. Certificate Filter System  
Creating a fully filterable certificate section with custom tags involved DOM manipulation and event handling with pure JavaScript.

### 6. Modal for Certificate Preview  
Building a full-screen modal overlay with proper open/close behavior, image handling, and scroll-lock added complexity to UI control logic.

### 7. Responsive Layout for All Devices  
Ensuring the site looked great and functioned well on all screen sizes meant extensive use of media queries and layout testing.

### 8. Right-to-Left (RTL) Design Considerations  
Designing in Arabic with RTL direction introduced layout challenges, especially when working with animation libraries that default to LTR behavior.

### 9. Animation Timing Conflicts  
Managing animation queues and preventing overlaps between AOS, GSAP, and custom triggers needed precise coordination and structure.

### 10. Keeping Code Clean and Scalable  
As the project grew, it became important to maintain clean code practices, reuse CSS variables, and structure scripts into logical blocks for scalability.

---

###  Solutions & Improvements ✅
- Regular use of browser dev tools and console for debugging
- Modular code structure with comments for easier navigation
- Deep reading of library documentation (GSAP, AOS, Typed.js)
- Testing responsiveness using Chrome DevTools across breakpoints
- Gradual performance optimizations (image sizing, animation limits)
