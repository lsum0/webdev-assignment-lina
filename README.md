##  Challenges I Faced 🧱

- Managing multiple animation libraries (GSAP, AOS, Typed.js, Particles.js)
- Building a fully responsive and synced loading screen
- Creating a custom dual-layer animated cursor
- Balancing smooth animations with page performance
- Implementing certificate filtering using vanilla JS
- Designing modal popups to preview certificates
- Ensuring responsive design across devices and browsers
- Managing right-to-left (RTL) layout compatibility with animations
- Handling animation timing and scroll-trigger issues
- Keeping code modular, clean, and maintainable

---

##  Solutions & Improvements ✅

- Used Chrome DevTools and JS console for debugging
- Modularized code with clear comments and CSS custom properties
- Consulted official docs (GSAP, AOS, Typed.js) for best practices
- Tested performance and animations across multiple screen sizes
- Compressed image sizes and optimized animation rendering
